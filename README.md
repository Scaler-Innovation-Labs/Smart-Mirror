### **1. Key Features**

#### **1.1 Interactive Camera & Display**

- **Camera integration**: High-definition camera embedded within the mirror for facial and outfit detection.

- **Real-time analysis**: Uses computer vision algorithms to detect facial features, outfit patterns, and colors.

- **Raspberry Pi**: Acts as the main processing unit, handling image processing, data handling, and user interactions.


#### **1.2 Style and Makeup Suggestions**

- **Outfit suggestions**: Based on weather, occasion, and the user's wardrobe (if integrated with an app).

- **Makeup tips**: Identifies user’s skin tone and suggests makeup ideas to complement their look.

- **Compliment feature**: Provides real-time, personalized compliments to boost user confidence.


#### **1.3 Conversational AI**

- **Voice recognition**: Allows for hands-free interaction, recognizing and responding to user commands.

- **Natural language processing (NLP)**: Uses AI to converse naturally, offering insights or responding to questions.

- **Personalized interactions**: Tailors responses based on prior interactions or user preferences.

- **Offline Processing:** Users would want their visual data to be processed offline, AI models using images from cameras need to run locally ensuring comfort of privacy.
